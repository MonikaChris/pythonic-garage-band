LAB - Class 04
Project: Pythonic Garage Band
Author: Monika Davies

About:
This project illustrates the use of classes in Python. It creates a Musician base class. Subclasses of Guitarist, Bassist, 
and Drummer inherit from Musician. It also creates a Band class which takes a name (string) and a list of Musician objects 
as members. Methods retrieve information about these objects and create behavior, such as playing solos.

How to run this application:
python3 band.py
